The C-API is for developers who want to use PocketPy
in a platform that is not supported by the official yet.

By running the following command on Linux/WSL,
you can get a single header file `pocketpy.h`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/blueloveth/pocketpy.git
cd pocketpy
python amalgamate.py
```
